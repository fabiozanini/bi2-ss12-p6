@article{CSBLAST,
	Abstract = {Sequence alignment and database searching are essential tools in biology because a protein's function can often be inferred from homologous proteins. Standard sequence comparison methods use substitution matrices to find the alignment with the best sum of similarity scores between aligned residues. These similarity scores do not take the local sequence context into account. Here, we present an approach that derives context-specific amino acid similarities from short windows centered on each query sequence residue. Our results demonstrate that the sequence context contains much more information about the expected mutations than just the residue itself. By employing our context-specific similarities (CS-BLAST) in combination with NCBI BLAST, we increase the sensitivity more than 2-fold on a difficult benchmark set, without loss of speed. Alignment quality is likewise improved significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrate considerable improvements when applying this paradigm to sequence profiles: Two iterations of CSI-BLAST, our context-specific version of PSI-BLAST, are more sensitive than 5 iterations of PSI-BLAST. The paradigm for biological sequence comparison presented here is very general. It can replace substitution matrices in sequence- and profile-based alignment and search methods for both protein and nucleotide sequences.},

@article{flaig1yje,
	Abstract = {NGFI-B is a ligand-independent orphan nuclear receptor of the NR4A subfamily that displays important functional differences with its homolog Nurr1. In particular, the NGFI-B ligand-binding domain (LBD) exhibits only modest activity in cell lines in which the Nurr1 LBD strongly activates transcription. To gain insight into the structural basis for the distinct activation potentials, we determined the crystal structure of the NGFI-B LBD at 2.4-{\AA} resolution. Superimposition with the Nurr1 LBD revealed a significant shift of the position of helix 12, potentially caused by conservative amino acids exchanges in helix 3 or helix 12. Replacement of the helix 11--12 region of Nurr1 with that of NGFI-B dramatically reduces the transcriptional activity of the Nurr1 LBD. Similarly, mutation of Met414 in helix 3 to leucine or of Leu591 in helix 12 to isoleucine (the corresponding residues found in NGFI-B) significantly affects Nurr1 transactivation. In comparison, swapping the helix 11--12 region of Nurr1 into NGFI-B results in a modest increase of activity. These observations reveal a high sensitivity of LBD activity to changes that influence helix 12 positioning. Furthermore, mutation of hydrophobic surface residues in the helix 11--12 region (outside the canonical co-activator surface constituted by helices 3, 4, and 12) severely affects Nurr1 transactivation. Together, our data suggest that a novel co-regulator surface that includes helix 11 and a specifically positioned helix 12 determine the cell type-dependent activities of the NGFI-B and the Nurr1 LBD.},
