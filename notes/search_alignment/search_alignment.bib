	abstract = {An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.},

	abstract = {{NGFI-B} is a ligand-independent orphan nuclear receptor of the {NR4A} subfamily that displays important functional differences with its homolog Nurr1. In particular, the {NGFI-B} ligand-binding domain {(LBD)} exhibits only modest activity in cell lines in which the Nurr1 {LBD} strongly activates transcription. To gain insight into the structural basis for the distinct activation potentials, we determined the crystal structure of the {NGFI-B} {LBD} at 2.4-Å resolution. Superimposition with the Nurr1 {LBD} revealed a significant shift of the position of helix 12, potentially caused by conservative amino acids exchanges in helix 3 or helix 12. Replacement of the helix 11–12 region of Nurr1 with that of {NGFI-B} dramatically reduces the transcriptional activity of the Nurr1 {LBD.} Similarly, mutation of Met414 in helix 3 to leucine or of Leu591 in helix 12 to isoleucine (the corresponding residues found in {NGFI-B)} significantly affects Nurr1 transactivation. In comparison, swapping the helix 11–12 region of Nurr1 into {NGFI-B} results in a modest increase of activity. These observations reveal a high sensitivity of {LBD} activity to changes that influence helix 12 positioning. Furthermore, mutation of hydrophobic surface residues in the helix 11–12 region (outside the canonical co-activator surface constituted by helices 3, 4, and 12) severely affects Nurr1 transactivation. Together, our data suggest that a novel co-regulator surface that includes helix 11 and a specifically positioned helix 12 determine the cell type-dependent activities of the {NGFI-B} and the Nurr1 {LBD.}},
