\begin{figure}[h!]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{1yje_A-3tx7_B.png}
  \caption{Example of a good model, our unknown sequence threaded onto 3XT7, chain B. Colors: red = our model, blue = 3XT7, chain B.}
  \label{fig:1yje_A-3xt7_B}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
Taylor has written a skeleton script (\texttt{model\_align.py}) that does the modelling onto a single template. I have slightly expanded it to to several independent models onto single templates (\texttt{align\_model\_all.py}). A good example is shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:1yje_A-3xt7_B}.

Also, now we have all PDB entries in \texttt{data/templates/pdb}, so we can in principle do multi-template modelling.
